WHAT IS IT?
===========

Complete Galactic Dominion (CGD) is a a cross-platform, networked real time strategy game (RTS) with a macro focus. 
It features planets with wrapping terrain (go off one edge and pop up on the other side) and management of cross-planet supply chains.

CGD is written for Python 2.6-2.7 and uses the Pygame module.



CAN I PLAY IT YET?
================
CGD is currently in the early stages of development, and as such, it is unplayable at the moment. 
However, we aim to have a working demo by Summer 2011.
