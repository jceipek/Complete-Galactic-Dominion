WHAT IS IT?
===========

Complete Galactic Dominion (CGD) is a a cross-platform, networked real time strategy game (RTS) with a macro focus. 
It features planets with wrapping terrain (go off one edge and pop up on the other side) and management of cross-planet supply chains.

The graphics are isometric 2d with pre-rendered 3d objects used as sprites.

CGD is written for Python 2.6-2.7 and uses the Pygame module.


CAN I PLAY IT YET?
=================
CGD is currently in the early stages of development, and as such, it is unplayable at the moment. 
However, we aim to have a working demo by Summer 2011.


HOW CAN I FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR SOURCE CODE DOES?
=================================================
We have tried to document the source code as well as possible, using the epytext (http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/manual-epytext.html)
markup language. This type of markup lends itself to some very readable documentation that can be accessed through /docs/index.html.
